This is the logical structure of the layered protocols inside a computer on an internet. 
Each computer that can communicate using internet techonology has such a logical structure. 
It is this logical structure that determines the behavior of the computer on the internet. 
The boxes represent processing of the data as it passes through the computer, and the lines 
connecting boxes show the path of data. The horizontal line at the bottom represents the 
Ethernet cable; the "o" is the transceiver. The "*" is the IP address and the "@" is the
Ethernet address. Understanding this logical structure is essential to understanding internet 
technology.

The name of a unit of data that flows through an internet is dependent upon where it exists in
the protocol stack. In summary:
  if it is on an Ethernet it is called an Ethernet frame;
  if it is between the Ethernet driver and the IP module it is called a IP packet;
  if it is between the IP module and the UDP module it is called a UDP datagram;
  if it is between the IP module and the TCP module it is called a TCP segment (transport msg);
  if it is in a network application it is called a application message.

A driver communicates directly with the network interface hardware.
A module communicates with a driver, with network applications, or with another module.
